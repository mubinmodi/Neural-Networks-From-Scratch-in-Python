# Neural Networks From Scratch in Python

This project implements neural networks from the ground up in Python, based on the book "Neural Networks from Scratch" by Harrison Kinsley. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of how neural networks function by coding them from scratch without using any machine learning libraries.

## Key Learnings

- Implemented core neural network components like layers, activation functions, and loss calculations using only NumPy
- Gained insight into the mathematical foundations of neural networks, including linear algebra and calculus concepts
- Developed a thorough understanding of forward and backward propagation algorithms
- Implemented various optimization techniques like gradient descent and adaptive learning rates
- Explored advanced topics like regularization, dropout, and convolutional layers
